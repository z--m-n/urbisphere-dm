# API

A data API that builts on `xpublish`, with features to manage input and output.

- [x] Plugins: extended to handle `json`, `geojson` and `mapbox` output.
- [x] Selection: slicing and subsets along dimensions and variables.
- [x] Non-static sources: extended to read and cache continuously updating sources.
- [x] Catalogues: configurable masks that link sources, filters and access management.
