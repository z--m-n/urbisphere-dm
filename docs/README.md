## Status
**Gen 1 (current)**: compiled from selected development workflows. 
These workflows were built around Notebooks, TOML configurations and Bash scripts. Their combination can be used for production/automation, although not recommended. As notebooks, the workflows are self-contained with limited cross-dependencies.  

**Gen 2 (next)**: code cleanup.
Implement classes, modules, type hinting, docstrings, tests, more.
