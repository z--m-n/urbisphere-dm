## Status
**Gen 1 (current)**: Repository from selected workflows. These development workflows were built around Notebooks, TOML configurations and Bash scripts. The combination can be used for production/automation, although not recommended. As notebooks, the workflows are mostly self-contained with limited cross-dependencies.  

**Gen 2 (next)**: Object oriented classes, code cleanup, type hinting, docstrings, unit tests, more. Not curently available.
